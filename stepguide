Create a new directory for the AI bot feature. You can name it "ai-bot".

Create a new Python file inside the "ai-bot" directory. You can name it "ai_bot.py". This file will contain the script for the AI bot.

Install the necessary Python libraries for the AI bot feature. You can use the following command in the terminal:

Copy code
pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3
Write the code for the AI bot in "ai_bot.py". Here is some sample code to get you started:
python
Copy code
import speech_recognition as sr
import pyttsx3

# Initialize the speech recognizer and the speech engine
r = sr.Recognizer()
engine = pyttsx3.init()

# Define a function to listen for and recognize speech
def recognize_speech():
    with sr.Microphone() as source:
        print("Listening...")
        audio = r.listen(source)
    try:
        text = r.recognize_google(audio)
        print("You said:", text)
        return text
    except sr.UnknownValueError:
        print("Sorry, I didn't catch that.")
        return None

# Define a function to speak a response
def speak(text):
    engine.say(text)
    engine.runAndWait()

# Main loop for the AI bot
while True:
    text = recognize_speech()
    if text is not None:
        if "hello" in text.lower():
            speak("Hello! How can I help you today?")
        elif "what can you do" in text.lower():
            speak("I can provide information about the features of this app, and I can help you navigate to different features. Just ask me!")
        elif "open events and activities" in text.lower():
            speak("Opening events and activities...")
            # Code to navigate to the events and activities feature
        else:
            speak("I'm sorry, I didn't understand that.")
In your main "index.js" file, add an event listener to the "AI bot" icon to trigger the AI bot script. Here is some sample code:
javascript
Copy code
// Get a reference to the AI bot icon
const aiBotIcon = document.querySelector('.ai-bot-icon');

// Add an event listener to the icon
aiBotIcon.addEventListener('click', () => {
  // Play a click sound
  const clickSound = new Audio('/sounds/click.mp3');
  clickSound.play();

  // Trigger the AI bot script
  const { spawn } = require('child_process');
  const aiBotProcess = spawn('python', ['./ai-bot/ai_bot.py']);
});
Test the AI bot feature by clicking on the "AI bot" icon in the app and speaking to it. You should hear a response from the bot.

Write tests for the AI bot feature. You can create a new test file named "ai_bot.test.js". Here is some sample code:

javascript
Copy code
// Import the necessary modules for testing
const { spawn } = require('child_process');
const assert = require('assert');

// Test the AI bot feature
describe('AI bot', function() {
  it('should respond to a "hello" command', function(done) {
    const aiBotProcess = spawn('python', ['./ai-bot/ai_bot.py']);
    aiBotProcess.stdout.once('data', (data) => {
      assert.equal(data.toString().trim(), 'Hello! How can I help you today?');
      aiBotProcess.kill();
      done();
    });
    aiBotProcess.stdin.write('hello\n');
  });

  it('should respond to an "open events and activities" command', function(done)
